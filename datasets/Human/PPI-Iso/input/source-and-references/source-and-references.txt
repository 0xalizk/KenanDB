                    Notice that his results in duplicate edges since some tests were done against the same interactor but in different ORFs (notice Interactor_ID column)

from the text ( the 1043 interactions mentioned here = no. of positives in  Isoform_ID #  Interactor_ID (i.e. 1 gene in 2 different ORFs  is counted twice):
"In total, we obtained high-quality PPI profiles for 366 protein isoforms encoded by 161 genes (Figure 2D and Table S2B). 
While 118 isoforms returned no binary PPIs, 248 isoforms had one or more interactions for a total of 1,043 binary PPIs with 381 proteins. "



This paper is interesting because you have protein-protein-interactions and you have isoform-protein interactions.
This can show whether network topology changes drastically if each node represents a certain protein isoform (one of many possible
alternatively-spliced isoform of the protein), rather than a protein. This should affect hubs. 
The network information is in Table S2B. 


This is from the text:

"First we performed yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screens in which all protein isoforms, fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain (DB), 
were tested against proteins encoded by the hORFeome v5.1 collection of ∼15,000 ORF clones fused to the Gal4 activation domain 
(AD) (Dreze et al., 2010, Rolland et al., 2014 and Rual et al., 2005). Following first-pass screening, each protein isoform was 
pairwise tested for interaction with the candidate partners identified not only for itself but also for all first-pass partners
 of all other protein isoforms encoded by the same gene, thus minimizing biases due to incomplete sampling sensitivity 
 (Venkatesan et al., 2009). To generate a final dataset of verified Y2H pairs, pairs showing a positive result in at 
 least two out of the three pairwise tests were subjected to a fourth pairwise retest, and PCR products amplified from 
 the final positive pairs were sequenced to confirm the identity of clones encoding each interacting protein 
 (Figure 2A and Table S2B). Western blots were performed for all protein isoforms of a subset of randomly picked genes, 
 demonstrating comparable heterologous protein expression of all isoforms of the same gene tested by Y2H (Figures 2B and S2A–S2H). 
 Finally, to validate the overall quality of the PPI dataset of human protein pairs identified by Y2H, we selected a representative 
 sample of the isoform-partner interacting and non-interacting pairs and subjected them to orthogonal validation in human HEK293T 
 cells using a protein complementation assay (PCA) (Dreze et al., 2010 and Rolland et al., 2014) (Figure 2C; Table S2C). 
 The isoform-partner positive pairs were recovered at a rate similar to that seen for pairs from a well-described positive 
 reference set (PRS) (Venkatesan et al., 2009), while isoform-partner negative pairs validated at a rate similar to that seen 
 for pairs from a random reference set (RRS) (Figure 2C and Tables S2C and S2D)."
